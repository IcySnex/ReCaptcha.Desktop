## Information
ReCaptcha.Desktop is an open source library to access Google's reCAPTCHA API on all majpr windows desktop frameworks including [WPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf), [WInUI3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/), [UWP](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/), [WinForms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms). ReCaptcha.Desktop focuses on simplicity and stability, which means you can get started with just a few lines of code.

ReCaptcha.Desktop is fast and reliable. It uses Microsoft's official [WebView2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) library on each specific plattform and the offical Google [reCAPTCHA widget/API](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/) to bring you the best performance and stability. Not only is ReCaptcha.Desktop fast but also highly customizable. You are able to change about anything - from themes to fundamental components.

## How it works
Since Google does not officially support any .NET desktop framework, ReCaptcha.Desktop has to use a [WebView2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) to display a custom reCAPTCHA widget.
But don't worry, ReCaptcha.Desktop is still fast and the user doesn't see any of the fancy actions. A window appears only when manual user input is requested by Google.
